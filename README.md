# CornHub
Gardening app for hardcore gardeners

----

# Project Brief
In one week, build a full-stack app (PostgreSQL, Python/Django, React) with CRUD functionality, working solo, in a pair, or in a group of three. I was asked to join a group with Paddy Johnson and Michael Henderson, two like-minded lockdown gardeners!

# Overview and Concept
I have discovered a real love for gardening during the first lockdown. When I am looking to grow plants, I often have to consult multiple sources in order to find all of the information I need concerning sowing, fertilizing, watering and many other things, and having to re-visit these sites to check this information. Paddy came to me and briefed me on his concept for a full stack gardening app that would have all of this information stored in one place, with several different approaches to searching and filtering - for example, by month, name, species, temperature or difficulty. The design and aesthetic of the app was to bring a humorous and dark theme to what is traditionally known as a cosy, middle class hoby, but something we believed to be anything but, which was the inspiration for the aptly named CornHub app.

# Approach Taken
The idea for the project came mostly formed- Paddy had been thinking about the project a few days prior to the start of the project. Once Michael and I had been recruited, we promptly fleshed out the pseudocode, with post-MVP features even listed in order of preference, and wireframes of design layout and user flow were made on Exacalidraw. We started a Trello for visibility, task assignment and assessment of priorities, and a Google Sheet for collecting information for our database. Crucially, we outlined models for our User and our Plants with every field that we felt we might conceivably need, so as to avoid having to make subsequent changes.
